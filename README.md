# Diabetes-Prediction

---
### Description
This is a classification exercise using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. I used machine learning models, such as LogisticRegression, RandomForest, SVM, XGBoost, to predict whether people are diabetic patients. The most interesting part of this exercise is that, in the data preprocessing process, I used the Leave-One-Out Encoding technique to encode the categorical variables and I used a power transform featurewise to make data more Gaussian-like.
